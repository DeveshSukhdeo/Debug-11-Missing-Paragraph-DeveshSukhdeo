    <h1>Choosing a Pet</h1> <!--The heading was in the body section instead of the head section so I removed it from the body section and added it in the head section-->

    <p>This page will help you choose between a dog, turtle, or a bird</p>
    <h2>Dogs</h2>
    <p>Dogs are the most work, but they are also the most fun.  You have to walk them every day, but they love you and will always play with you.</p>
    <h2>Turtles</h2>
    <p>Turtles can also be fun, but they don't play with you.  They will not make a mess of your room and they are quiet.</p> <!--The starting tag for the paragraph was <p. instead of <p> so I changed it to <p> so the paragraph would appear on the web page--> 
    <h2>Birds</h2>
    <p>Birds kind of play with you, but they are a lot of trouble and might fly away or start flying all around your room and make a mess of it.</p>
